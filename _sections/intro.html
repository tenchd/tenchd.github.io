  <h2 class="alt">Hi! I'm David Tench, a computer science researcher interested in processing massive datasets.</h2>
  <p>I design space-efficient, memory-hierarchy-aware algorithms and build systems to address massive-scale problems in areas like bioinformatics, databases, network measurement, and machine learning. I am particularly interested in designing and implementing practical graph streaming and sketching algorithms.</p>
