<p>I'm a postdoctoral researcher in <a href= "https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/">Computer Science at Rutgers University</a> advised by <a href="https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~farach/">Martin Farach-Colton </a> and <a href= "https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~bender/">Michael Bender</a>. I am supported by a <a href  ="https://cifellows2021.org/#overview">NSF Computing Innovation Fellowship</a>.  I completed my PhD at UMass Amherst in the College of Information and Computer Science, where I was advised by <a href= "https://people.cs.umass.edu/~mcgregor/">Andrew McGregor</a>. I design algorithms and build systems for large-scale computation, in particular graph sketching algorithms for graphs that are massive, dense, and change over time. I apply these algorithms and systems to real-world problems in areas like databases, bioinformatics, network measurement, and machine learning.</p>
