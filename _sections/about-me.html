<p>I am the 2023 <a href= "https://cs.lbl.gov/careers/computing-fellowships/hopper-fellowship/">Grace Hopper postdoctoral researcher </a> at <a href= "https://cs.lbl.gov/">Lawrence Berkeley Labs </a> advised by <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~aydin/">Aydin Bulu√ß</a>. Before that, I was an NSF Computing Innovation Fellow at Rutgers University advised by <a href="https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~farach/">Martin Farach-Colton </a> and <a href= "https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~bender/">Michael Bender</a>. I completed my PhD at UMass Amherst in the College of Information and Computer Science, where I was advised by <a href= "https://people.cs.umass.edu/~mcgregor/">Andrew McGregor</a>. I design algorithms and build systems for large-scale computation, in particular graph sketching algorithms for graphs that are massive, dense, and change over time. I apply these algorithms and systems to real-world problems in areas like databases, bioinformatics, network measurement, and machine learning.</p>
